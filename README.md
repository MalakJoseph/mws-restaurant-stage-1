### About the Project
* Udacity gives the code for a restaurant review website that lacks `Accessibility` and `Offline Experience`.
* `Responsive Design` also was messed up for different viewport sizes.
* All i have to do was making the site `Responsive` for different viewport sizes, implement `Accessibility` concept and make the website work offline through `Service Worker`.
